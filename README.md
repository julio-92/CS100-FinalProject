# Task Scheduler
 * This program is important for us as it allows us to develop an organized priority list for us students as we balance school and work in our lives. It is also interesting as it gives us an opportunity to make a program that can be used in different ways and organized in a multitude of ways depending on the individuals.
* We plan to use the C++ programming language. The tools were going to be using is Visual Studio code as our ide, Git and GitHub as our Repository and workspace to collaborate, we will also be using the kanban board to track individuals progress as the weeks go by.
 * The input will be the user creating tasks including a title, description, classification (e.g. personal, work, study), priority, due date, along with an undo function. The output will be the schedule of tasks in a display as an HTML file or in the program itself.
* The features will include the ability to display, edit, and delete tasks and task lists.
